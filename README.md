# LSTM-for-call-transcript-sentiment-classification-over-call
This module helps place a call and transcribe the audio on the other side and then goes on to do a sentiment analysis

## This repository contains a Python script for making a phone call using Twilio, recording the call, and performing various operations on the recorded audio. The script uses a pre-trained sentiment recognition model to analyze the recorded audio and extract the emotional sentiment. It also utilizes a speech-to-text conversion library to convert the recorded audio to text and generate a summary of the conversation.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

NumPy: pip install numpy
Requests: pip install requests
Twilio: pip install twilio
Keras: pip install keras

## to install all the required libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt
